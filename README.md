## Getting started on Netlify
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/iteria-app/example-material-ui&stack=cms) to get your own copy of the repository. This button will do the following:
- Connect to your GitHub account and create a new repository with the name you specify
- Deploy your copy of the repository and setup continuous deployment

Next steps:
1. Customization: Now you're all set and you can start customizing your site (see [docs](https://docs.iteria.app/docs/category/features)).
2. Consider connecting to your own GraphQL/Hasura endpoint (see [docs](https://docs.iteria.app/docs/getting-started/change-graphql-endpoint)).
3. Even non technical users can collaborate once deployed to netlify! (see [docs](https://docs.iteria.app/docs/category/extras))

## Getting started on localhost
You can run this demo locally using https://vitejs.dev/ with all you development tools.

## Getting started on Gitpod
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/iteria-app/example-material-ui) to develop using vscode in cloud. Every Lowcode release is tested also in Gitpod.

## Getting started on Stackblitz, Codespace
In future [#72](https://github.com/iteria-app/example-material-ui/issues/72) we might support [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/iteria-app/example-material-ui) or codespaces.
